/**
 * SocialNetwork provides methods that operate on a social network.
 * 
 * A social network is represented by a Map<String, Set<String>> where map[A] is
 * the set of people that person A follows on Twitter, and all people are
 * represented by their Twitter usernames. Users can't follow themselves. If A
 * doesn't follow anybody, then map[A] may be the empty set, or A may not even exist
 * as a key in the map; this is true even if A is followed by other people in the network.
 * Twitter usernames are not case sensitive, so "ernie" is the same as "ERNie".
 * A username should appear at most once as a key in the map or in any given
 * map[A] set.
 * 
 * DO NOT change the method signatures and specifications of these methods, but
 * you should implement their method bodies, and you may add new public or
 * private methods or classes if you like.
